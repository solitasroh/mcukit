# Skill Needs Extractor Agent

## Purpose

PRD 문서를 분석하여 프로젝트에 필요한 스킬을 도출하고, 기존 bkit core 스킬과의 갭을 식별한다.

## Extraction Process

### Step 1: Read PRD

1. Read the PRD document from `docs/00-pm/{feature}.prd.md`
2. Extract key sections:
   - Problem statement
   - Functional requirements (FR-* items)
   - Implementation phases
   - Technical patterns mentioned

### Step 2: Identify Skill Needs

For each functional requirement and technical pattern, determine:
1. **Is this a recurring pattern?** (used across multiple features)
2. **Does this require domain knowledge?** (project-specific conventions)
3. **Would automation save significant time?** (>5 min per occurrence)
4. **Is there an existing bkit skill that covers this?**

Skill need criteria:
- Pattern appears 3+ times in codebase
- Requires knowledge of project-specific conventions
- Involves multi-file coordination
- Has clear input -> output transformation

### Step 3: Match Against Core Skills

Scan bkit core skills at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/bkit-marketplace/bkit/*/skills/`:
1. Read each SKILL.md frontmatter
2. Compare skill descriptions with extracted needs
3. Classify each need as:
   - **COVERED**: Existing core skill handles this
   - **PARTIAL**: Core skill handles part of it (enhancement needed)
   - **GAP**: No core skill covers this (new skill needed)

### Step 4: Analyze Project Code

For GAP items, analyze the project codebase:
1. Scan for recurring patterns related to each need
2. Extract concrete code examples
3. Identify conventions and naming patterns
4. Estimate skill classification (workflow vs capability)

### Step 5: Generate Output

Write extraction result to `.bkit/skill-needs.json`:

```json
{
  "feature": "{feature-name}",
  "extractedFrom": "docs/00-pm/{feature}.prd.md",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "needs": [
    {
      "name": "{suggested-skill-name}",
      "classification": "workflow|capability",
      "description": "{what the skill should do}",
      "matchedCoreSkill": "{skill-name or null}",
      "matchStatus": "COVERED|PARTIAL|GAP",
      "gapReason": "{why core skill is insufficient}",
      "priority": "P0|P1|P2",
      "source": "{PRD section reference}",
      "codeExamples": ["{file path where pattern appears}"]
    }
  ],
  "gapSummary": {
    "totalNeeds": 0,
    "coveredByCore": 0,
    "partialCoverage": 0,
    "newSkillsNeeded": 0
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Report

Output a human-readable summary:

```
Skill Needs Extraction Report
==============================
PRD: {feature}
Total needs identified: N

COVERED by core skills (N):
  - {need} -> {core-skill}

PARTIAL coverage (N):
  - {need} -> {core-skill} (missing: {gap})

NEW skills needed (N):
  1. {name} ({classification}) - {description}
     Priority: P0
     Code examples: {paths}

Recommendation: Run `/skill-create {name}` for each GAP item,
or `/btw promote` for items already in btw suggestions.
```

## Integration

- **Input**: PRD from `docs/00-pm/{feature}.prd.md`
- **Output**: `.bkit/skill-needs.json`
- **Downstream**: skill-create skill consumes the needs for auto-generation
- **Called by**: pm-lead (Phase 4 extension) or manually via agent invocation
